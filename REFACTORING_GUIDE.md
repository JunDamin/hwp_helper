# HWP Helper Refactoring Guide

## Overview

This document describes the refactoring of the HWP Helper codebase to improve maintainability, testability, and code organization.

## New Project Structure

```

## Key Improvements

### 1. Separation of Concerns

- **Core**: Application lifecycle and configuration management
- **Services**: Business logic and HWP operations
- **UI**: User interface components and pages
- **Utils**: Utility functions and helpers
- **Callbacks**: Complex operation callbacks

### 2. Better Class Relationships

#### Before:
- Direct dependencies between UI components and HWP API
- Mixed responsibilities in single files
- Tight coupling between components

#### After:
- **Dependency Injection**: Components receive dependencies through context
- **Service Layer**: Business logic separated from UI
- **Configuration Management**: Centralized configuration handling
- **App Manager**: Centralized HWP application management

### 3. Improved Architecture Patterns

#### Context Pattern
```python
context = {
    "helper": helper,
    "page": page,
    "app": app,
    "config": config_manager,
    "app_manager": app_manager,
}
```

#### Service Layer Pattern
```python
# Services handle business logic
template_service = TemplateService()
hwp_ops = HwpOperationService(app_manager)

# UI components use services
template_service.add_template(app, category, name)
hwp_ops.insert_template(template_path, move_count)
```

#### Configuration Management
```python
# Centralized configuration
config = ConfigManager("setting.yaml")
config.set("app_width", 800)
config.save_config()
```

### 4. Enhanced Error Handling

- Proper exception handling in services
- Graceful degradation when HWP is not available
- Better error reporting and logging

### 5. Improved Testability

- Services can be easily mocked and tested
- UI components are decoupled from business logic
- Configuration is injectable and testable

## Migration from Old Structure

### File Mapping

| Old File | New Location | Notes |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| `main.py` | `main.py` | Simplified, uses new structure |
| `core.py` | `hwp_helper/core/helper.py` | Split into multiple files |
| `functions.py` | `hwp_helper/utils/` | Split by functionality |
| `callback.py` | `hwp_helper/callbacks/hwp_callbacks.py` | Moved to callbacks package |
| `components.py` | `hwp_helper/ui/components/` | Split into multiple components |
| `features.py` | `hwp_helper/ui/pages/features.py` | Moved to pages |
| `templates.py` | `hwp_helper/ui/pages/templates.py` | Moved to pages |
| `navibar.py` | `hwp_helper/ui/components/navigation.py` | Moved to components |

### Key Changes

1. **Import Updates**: All imports now use the new package structure
2. **Context Passing**: Components receive context dictionary instead of individual parameters
3. **Service Usage**: Business logic is now handled by service classes
4. **Configuration**: Settings are managed through ConfigManager
5. **App Management**: HWP app lifecycle is managed by HwpAppManager

## Benefits of New Structure

### 1. Maintainability
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easier to locate and modify specific functionality
- Reduced code duplication

### 2. Testability
- Services can be unit tested independently
- UI components can be tested with mocked services
- Configuration can be injected for testing

### 3. Extensibility
- Easy to add new services
- Simple to create new UI components
- Straightforward to add new features

### 4. Code Reusability
- Services can be reused across different UI components
- Utilities are centralized and reusable
- Configuration management is consistent

### 5. Better Error Handling
- Centralized error handling in services
- Graceful degradation when dependencies are unavailable
- Better user feedback for errors

## Running the Refactored Application

The application entry point remains the same:

```bash
python main.py
```

Or if installed as a package:

```bash
hwp-helper
```

## Development Guidelines

### Adding New Features

1. **Business Logic**: Add to appropriate service in `services/`
2. **UI Components**: Add to `ui/components/` or `ui/pages/`
3. **Utilities**: Add to appropriate utility module in `utils/`
4. **Configuration**: Use `ConfigManager` for persistent settings

### Code Organization

- Keep UI components focused on presentation
- Put business logic in services
- Use dependency injection through context
- Handle errors gracefully
- Write clear docstrings and type hints

### Testing Strategy

- Unit test services independently
- Mock dependencies for UI component tests
- Integration tests for end-to-end workflows
- Configuration tests with temporary files

## Backwards Compatibility

The refactored code maintains the same user interface and functionality as the original version. All existing features work identically, but the internal structure is significantly improved.

## Future Enhancements

The new structure enables several future improvements:

1. **Plugin System**: Easy to add new operation plugins
2. **Theme Support**: UI theming can be added to components
3. **Internationalization**: Text can be externalized and localized
4. **Advanced Testing**: Comprehensive test suite can be added
5. **Performance Optimization**: Services can be optimized independently
6. **Configuration UI**: Settings can be managed through a UI
7. **Logging System**: Comprehensive logging can be added
8. **Update System**: Application updates can be managed centrally

## Conclusion

This refactoring significantly improves the codebase quality while maintaining all existing functionality. The new structure is more maintainable, testable, and extensible, providing a solid foundation for future development.
